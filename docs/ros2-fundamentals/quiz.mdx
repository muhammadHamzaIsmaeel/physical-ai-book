## Section 1: Nodes & Topics

### Question 1: Node Lifecycle

What is the correct order of operations for a ROS 2 node's lifecycle?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: `rclpy.init()` → Create node instance → `rclpy.spin()` → `destroy_node()` → `rclpy.shutdown()`

**Explanation**:
1. `rclpy.init()` initializes the ROS 2 context
2. Node instance is created (inherits from `Node` class)
3. `rclpy.spin()` processes callbacks and keeps node running
4. `destroy_node()` cleans up node resources
5. `rclpy.shutdown()` shuts down ROS 2 context

**Reference**: See `nodes-topics.mdx:45-49` for node lifecycle details.

### Question 2: Topic Communication

A publisher publishes to `/cmd_vel` at 10 Hz. A subscriber subscribes to `/cmd_Vel` (capital V). What happens?

A) Subscriber receives all messages
B) Subscriber receives no messages
C) Subscriber receives messages but with delay
D) ROS 2 throws a compilation error

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: B) Subscriber receives no messages

**Explanation**: Topic names are **case-sensitive** in ROS 2. `/cmd_vel` and `/cmd_Vel` are two different topics. The subscriber won't receive any messages because it's listening to a different topic than the publisher is sending to.

**Common Pitfall**: This is one of the most frequent debugging issues. Always use `ros2 topic list` and `rqt_graph` to verify topic names match exactly.

**Reference**: See `nodes-topics.mdx:453-475` for common pitfalls.

### Question 3: Quality of Service (QoS)

Which QoS setting is best for high-frequency sensor data where occasional packet loss is acceptable?

A) RELIABLE reliability + TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability
B) BEST_EFFORT reliability + VOLATILE durability
C) RELIABLE reliability + VOLATILE durability
D) BEST_EFFORT reliability + TRANSIENT_LOCAL durability

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: B) BEST_EFFORT reliability + VOLATILE durability

**Explanation**:
- **BEST_EFFORT**: No retransmission of lost packets = lower latency (good for sensor data at 30 Hz, 60 Hz, etc.)
- **VOLATILE**: Late subscribers only get new messages (no need to cache old sensor readings)

Use RELIABLE for critical commands (e.g., emergency stop), but BEST_EFFORT for continuous streams where the next reading makes the previous one obsolete.

**Reference**: See `nodes-topics.mdx:327-366` for QoS profiles.

## Section 2: Services & Actions

### Question 4: Service vs Action

Which communication pattern should you use for a robot task that takes 30 seconds and needs progress updates every 2 seconds?

A) Topic (pub-sub)
B) Service (request-response)
C) Action (goal-feedback-result)
D) Parameter

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: C) Action (goal-feedback-result)

**Explanation**: Use actions for long-running tasks (>1 second) that need:
- **Feedback**: Progress updates during execution
- **Cancellation**: Ability to abort mid-execution
- **Result**: Final outcome when complete

Services are for quick operations (under 1 second) with no feedback. Topics are for continuous streams, not request-based tasks.

**Example**: Navigation to a waypoint, grasping an object, executing a trajectory.

**Reference**: See `services-actions.mdx:272-302` for action vs service comparison.
</details>

### Question 5: Service Definition

Given this service definition:
```
int64 a
int64 b
---
int64 sum
```

What does the `---` separator indicate?

A) Comments in the file
B) Separates request (above) from response (below)
C) Separates imports from definitions
D) Marks the end of the file

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: B) Separates request (above) from response (below)

**Explanation**: In ROS 2 service definitions (`.srv` files):
- **Above `---`**: Request fields (what the client sends)
- **Below `---`**: Response fields (what the server returns)

For actions (`.action` files), there are **two** `---` separators:
1. Goal (top)
2. Result (middle)
3. Feedback (bottom)

**Reference**: See `services-actions.mdx:256-268` for service introspection.
</details>

## Section 3: Parameters & Launch Files

### Question 6: Parameter Declaration

What happens if you call `self.get_parameter('speed')` without first calling `declare_parameter('speed', default_value)`?

A) Returns None
B) Returns 0
C) Throws `ParameterNotDeclaredException`
D) Uses a random default value

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: C) Throws `ParameterNotDeclaredException`

**Explanation**: ROS 2 requires explicit parameter declaration before use. This prevents typos and ensures all parameters are documented with defaults.

**Correct pattern**:
```python
# Declare first
self.declare_parameter('speed', 1.0)

# Then get
speed = self.get_parameter('speed').value
```

**Common mistake**: Forgetting to declare parameters in `__init__()`.

**Reference**: See `parameters-launch.mdx:636-650` for parameter pitfalls.
</details>

### Question 7: YAML Parameter File Structure

Which YAML structure is **correct** for ROS 2 parameter files?

**Option A**:
```yaml
my_node:
  speed: 1.0
  topic: /cmd_vel
```

**Option B**:
```yaml
my_node:
  ros__parameters:
    speed: 1.0
    topic: /cmd_vel
```

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: Option B

**Explanation**: ROS 2 parameter files require the `ros__parameters` key (with **double underscore**):

```yaml
node_name:
  ros__parameters:    # Required!
    param1: value1
    param2: value2
```

Without `ros__parameters`, the parameters won't be loaded, and the node will use default values.

**Reference**: See `parameters-launch.mdx:177-201` for YAML structure and `parameters-launch.mdx:672-688` for troubleshooting.
</details>

### Question 8: Launch File Namespaces

You launch two nodes with `namespace='robot1'`. What topics do they create?

**Original topics**: `/cmd_vel`, `/scan`

A) `/cmd_vel`, `/scan` (unchanged)
B) `/robot1/cmd_vel`, `/robot1/scan`
C) `/robot1_cmd_vel`, `/robot1_scan`
D) `/cmd_vel/robot1`, `/scan/robot1`

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: B) `/robot1/cmd_vel`, `/robot1/scan`

**Explanation**: Namespaces in ROS 2 prefix all node names and topic names with the namespace:

```python
Node(
    package='my_package',
    executable='controller',
    namespace='robot1',  # Topics become /robot1/*
)
```

This enables multi-robot systems where each robot operates in its own namespace, preventing topic name collisions.

**Use case**: Running 3 identical robots on the same network with namespaces `robot1`, `robot2`, `robot3`.

**Reference**: See `parameters-launch.mdx:713-767` for multi-robot example.
</details>

## Section 4: Debugging Tools

### Question 9: Debugging Pub-Sub Issues

A subscriber isn't receiving messages. You run `ros2 topic echo /chatter` and **do** see messages. What does this tell you?

A) The publisher is broken
B) The topic name is wrong
C) The subscriber code has a bug
D) QoS settings are incompatible

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: C) The subscriber code has a bug

**Explanation**: If `ros2 topic echo` can receive messages, it proves:
- ✅ Publisher is working
- ✅ Topic name is correct
- ✅ Messages are being sent
- ✅ QoS is compatible (echo uses default settings)

The problem must be in the **subscriber code**:
- Callback function not registered correctly
- Subscriber not being spun (`rclpy.spin()` missing)
- Exception in callback silently failing

**Debug next**: Add logging to subscriber's `__init__()` and callback to see if they execute.

**Reference**: See `debugging-tools.mdx:571-614` for pub-sub debugging workflow.
</details>

### Question 10: ROS 2 Bag Files

You record a bag file with `ros2 bag record /cmd_vel /scan`. What can you do with this bag file?

A) Replay the recorded data to test algorithms offline
B) Inspect the data to debug past issues
C) Share the data with team members
D) All of the above

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answer**: D) All of the above

**Explanation**: ROS 2 bag files are incredibly versatile:

1. **Replay for testing**: `ros2 bag play my_bag` - Test your algorithm on real data without the robot
2. **Debugging**: `ros2 bag info my_bag` - See exactly what data was recorded when the bug occurred
3. **Collaboration**: Share bag files with team members for reproducible testing
4. **Dataset creation**: Record training data for machine learning

**Advanced usage**:
- Replay at different speeds: `ros2 bag play -r 2.0` (2x speed)
- Replay in loop: `ros2 bag play -l`
- Replay specific topics: `ros2 bag play my_bag --topics /cmd_vel`

**Reference**: See `debugging-tools.mdx:205-241` for bag file commands.

## Bonus Question: Integration

### Bonus: Complete System Design

Design a system with these requirements:
- 2 robots operating simultaneously
- Each robot has a lidar sensor publishing at 10 Hz
- Each robot has a velocity controller
- All robots use the same code but different parameters

What ROS 2 concepts would you use? (Select all that apply)

A) Namespaces to separate robots
B) Parameters to configure each robot differently
C) Launch file to start all nodes together
D) Topics for sensor data and commands
E) Services for sensor configuration

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct Answers**: A, B, C, D (not E - services aren't needed for this design)

**Explanation**:

**Architecture**:
```python
# Launch file structure
for robot in ['robot1', 'robot2']:
    # Lidar node (publishes /scan at 10 Hz)
    Node(
        package='sensors',
        executable='lidar',
        namespace=robot,  # A: Namespace
        parameters=[{     # B: Parameters
            'publish_rate': 10.0,
            'frame_id': f'{robot}/lidar_link'
        }]
    )

    # Velocity controller
    Node(
        package='control',
        executable='controller',
        namespace=robot,
        parameters=[{
            'max_speed': 0.5 if robot == 'robot1' else 1.0
        }],
        remappings=[
            ('/cmd_vel', '/mobile_base/cmd_vel')
        ]
    )
```

**Topics created**:
- `/robot1/scan` (lidar data) - D: Topic
- `/robot1/mobile_base/cmd_vel` (velocity commands) - D: Topic
- `/robot2/scan`
- `/robot2/mobile_base/cmd_vel`

**Launch**: C: Single launch file starts all 4 nodes

**Not needed**: E: Services aren't required for continuous sensor data or periodic configuration (parameters handle that).

**Reference**: See `parameters-launch.mdx:713-767` for multi-robot system example.
