## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all content work
- **User Stories (Phases 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Chapters 1-2): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (Chapters 3-5): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US3 (Chapters 6, 10-11): Depends on US1 completion (requires Isaac Sim from Chapter 2 setup)
  - US4 (Chapters 7-9): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (parallel with US3)
  - US5 (Chapter 12): Depends on US4 completion (needs perception and manipulation concepts)
  - US6 (Chapter 13 + Capstone): Depends on ALL previous stories (US1-US5) - integration milestone
  - US7 (Appendix A): Can start after US1 completion (needs hardware knowledge from Chapter 2)
  - US8 (Appendix C): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on US1-US6 completion (core content complete), US7-US8 optional for MVP

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Chapters 01-02 - Foundation for all other work
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Chapters 03-05 - Independent of US3/US4, can proceed in parallel
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Chapters 06, 10-11 - Requires US1 Isaac Sim setup, otherwise independent
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Chapters 07-09 - Independent, can proceed in parallel with US3
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Chapter 12 - Requires US4 completion (locomotion and manipulation concepts needed)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Chapter 13 + Capstone - Requires US1-US5 (integration of all concepts)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Appendix A - Requires US1 (hardware knowledge), otherwise independent
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Appendix C - Independent, can proceed any time after Foundational

### Critical Path for MVP (P1 Stories Only)

```
Setup (Phase 1) → Foundational (Phase 2) → US1 (Chapters 1-2) → US3 (Chapters 6, 10-11) → Beta Test → Launch
                                         ↘ US2 (Chapters 3-5) ↗
```

MVP delivers: Working VLA pipeline with voice commands (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003 satisfied)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T011 marked [P] can all run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T013-T022 marked [P] can all run in parallel
- **User Story Phases**: After Foundational completes, US1, US2, US4, US7, US8 can all start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- **Within Each Chapter**: Content writing [P], diagram creation [P], quiz creation [P] can run in parallel
- **Code Examples**: All code example creation tasks marked [P] within a user story can run in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: Tasks T164-T178 marked [P] can all run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Chapters 03-05)

```bash
# Can launch together (different chapters, no dependencies):
Task T038: "Create Chapter 03 directory docs/ros2-fundamentals/"
Task T051: "Create Chapter 04 directory docs/urdf-digital-twins/"
Task T057: "Create Chapter 05 directory docs/simulation-ecosystem/"

# Within Chapter 03, can launch together (different files):
Task T040: "Create Python code example: Simple ROS 2 publisher"
Task T041: "Create Python code example: Simple ROS 2 subscriber"
Task T044: "Create Python code example: ROS 2 service client/server"
Task T045: "Create Python code example: ROS 2 action client/server"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

**Target**: Working VLA pipeline demonstrating Physical AI capabilities (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Chapters 01-02) - Workstation setup
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Chapters 03-05) - ROS 2 + Simulation fundamentals
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Chapters 06, 10-11) - VLA pipeline
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 stories independently with beta reader
7. Deploy MVP to GitHub Pages staging
8. Collect feedback before proceeding to P2 stories

**MVP Scope**: 8 chapters (01-06, 10-11), basic Troubleshooting Bible (40 entries), VLA code examples, validation script

**Estimated Effort**: 30-45 working days for MVP

### Incremental Delivery (Full Book)

**Target**: Complete book with all 13 chapters + 3 appendices + capstone (all success criteria)

1. Complete MVP (Phases 1-5) → Test → Deploy staging (MVP launch)
2. Add Phase 6: User Story 4 (Chapters 07-09) → Test independently → Update staging
3. Add Phase 7: User Story 5 (Chapter 12) → Test independently → Update staging
4. Add Phase 8: User Story 6 (Chapter 13 + Capstone) → Test independently → Update staging
5. Add Phase 9: User Story 7 (Appendix A) → Update staging
6. Add Phase 10: User Story 8 (Appendix C) → Update staging
7. Complete Phase 11: Polish & Final Validation → Beta test → Deploy production

**Full Scope**: 13 chapters + 3 appendices, complete Troubleshooting Bible (100 entries), capstone project, all YouTube videos

**Estimated Effort**: 55-80 working days for full book (1-3 months calendar time depending on work intensity)

### Completion-Driven Daily Workflow

**Approach**: Work on highest-priority incomplete phase until done, then advance to next phase. No fixed daily targets.

**Daily Process**:
1. Check current phase status (Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → ...)
2. Identify incomplete tasks in current phase
3. Work on as many tasks as feasible in the day (prioritize blocking tasks first)
4. Mark tasks complete as finished
5. When phase complete, advance to next phase
6. If scope fatigue occurs, trigger MVP fallback (complete only P1 stories, launch, continue post-launch)

**Progress Tracking**:
- Use task checkboxes to track completion
- Estimate: US1 takes 8-12 days, US2 takes 10-15 days, US3 takes 12-18 days
- Actual duration varies based on daily work capacity and content generation efficiency

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to specific user stories for traceability (US1-US8)
- **Tests not included**: This is a documentation project - no automated test tasks needed
- **Research tasks**: Phase 0 research (R1-R6 from plan.md) embedded in relevant user story phases
- **Content validation**: Human review focuses on technical accuracy (all code tested on Ubuntu 22.04), readability (Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- **MVP strategy**: P1 stories (US1-US3) deliver working VLA pipeline - sufficient for initial launch
- **Completion-driven**: No fixed calendar dates - work daily until phase complete, then advance
- **Constitution compliance**: All tasks aligned with 7 core principles (spec-first, AI-native, truth-seeking, progressive enhancement, open-source, accessibility, performance)
- **Beta testing critical**: External reader validation (SC-010) essential before production launch
- **Quarterly maintenance**: After launch, update hardware pricing (Appendix A), link validation, VLA model references quarterly

**Total Tasks**: 194 tasks across 11 phases
**MVP Tasks**: 113 tasks (Phases 1-5 for P1 stories)
**Estimated MVP Effort**: 30-45 working days
**Estimated Full Book Effort**: 55-80 working days

**Success Gate for Launch**: All P1 user stories complete (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003), constitution gates pass, beta reader validates, Lighthouse ≥90/95/95/95, zero dead links, build <7 min, repo <600 MB
