# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Building Embodied Intelligence with ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action Models**

*A Hands-On Capstone Journey from Digital Brain to Physical Body (2026 Edition)*

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this book, you'll go from **"Hello World" in ROS 2** to deploying a **simulated (and optionally real) humanoid robot** that:

- ✅ Accepts natural-language voice commands ("*Pick up the red cup and place it on the table*")
- ✅ Understands visual scenes using Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
- ✅ Executes complex physical tasks autonomously (navigation, manipulation, multi-step sequences)
- ✅ Runs on accessible hardware (RTX 4070 Ti+, ~$700-$3,000 budget)

**Your capstone project**: An **autonomous humanoid butler** that performs household tasks end-to-end.
