### Step 2: Mount the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Dev Kit

*   **Materials**: Jetson Orin Nano Dev Kit, standoffs, M2/M3 screws.
*   **Instructions**: Find a suitable location on the chassis platform. Use standoffs to secure the Jetson board, ensuring access to USB ports and power.

### Step 3: Integrate Motor Driver and Power Management

*   **Materials**: Motor driver, buck converter, power bank, jumper wires.
*   **Instructions**:
    1.  Mount the motor driver and buck converter to the chassis.
    2.  Wire the power bank to the Jetson (USB-C PD) and to the buck converter input (if using a 12V power bank output for motors).
    3.  Connect the DC motors to the motor driver output.
    4.  Connect Jetson GPIO pins to the motor driver input for control signals.

### Step 4: Install Perception Sensors (Camera & LiDAR)

*   **Materials**: Stereo USB Camera, USB LiDAR, USB hub, custom 3D printed mounts (optional).
*   **Instructions**:
    1.  Design and 3D print (or use existing brackets) mounts for the camera and LiDAR. Position the camera for a clear forward view, and the LiDAR to ensure a 360-degree scan without robot obstruction.
    2.  Secure sensors to the mounts.
    3.  Connect sensors to the powered USB hub, and the hub to the Jetson.

## 3. Validation Checklist (T146)

After assembly, use this checklist to validate your Economy Lab Tier robot. Each item should be tested to ensure basic functionality before proceeding to software setup.

### Power & Basic Functionality

*   [ ] Robot powers on (Jetson LED lights up).
*   [ ] Jetson boots successfully to Ubuntu desktop (connect external monitor for first boot).
*   [ ] All motors can be manually actuated (e.g., by directly applying voltage for a brief test).

### Sensor Tests (via ROS 2)

*   [ ] **Stereo Camera**:
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows camera image topics (e.g., `/camera/left/image_raw`, `/camera/right/image_raw`).
    *   [ ] `rqt_image_view` displays live camera feeds.
*   [ ] **LiDAR**:
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows LiDAR scan topic (e.g., `/scan`).
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic echo /scan` shows data.
    *   [ ] `rviz2` (with a `LaserScan` display) shows live LiDAR data.

### Actuator Tests (via ROS 2)

*   [ ] **Motors**:
    *   [ ] A simple ROS 2 publisher node can send commands to the motor driver.
    *   [ ] Robot responds to `/cmd_vel` messages (e.g., moves forward, turns).
    *   [ ] Odometry topic `/odom` is published and appears reasonable in `rviz2`.

### Communication & Network

*   [ ] Jetson can connect to Wi-Fi.
*   [ ] You can SSH into the Jetson from your host PC.
*   [ ] ROS 2 communication between host PC and Jetson works (e.g., `ros2 topic echo` on host shows topics published by Jetson).

### Software & ROS 2 Environment

*   [ ] ROS 2 Jazzy is correctly installed and sourced on the Jetson.
*   [ ] `colcon build` can successfully build a simple ROS 2 package on the Jetson.
*   [ ] Python 3.10+ is the default Python interpreter for ROS 2.

### Final Check

*   [ ] All cables are securely fastened and managed.
*   [ ] No loose components.
*   [ ] Power source (power bank) is fully charged.

Once all items in this checklist are marked, your Economy Lab Tier robot is physically ready for software development and experimentation!
