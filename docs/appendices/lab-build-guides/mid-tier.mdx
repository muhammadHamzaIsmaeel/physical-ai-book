## 3. Validation Checklist (T150)

Use this checklist to validate your Mid-Tier Lab Go2 robot. Each item ensures that hardware, communication, and basic software are ready for development.

### Robot Hardware & Basic Control

*   [ ] Go2 powers on and performs its startup sequence.
*   [ ] Remote controller pairs successfully and can command basic movements (walk, stand, sit).
*   [ ] Robot maintains stability during basic movements.
*   [ ] Battery level is monitored via Go2 SDK tools.

### Network & Communication

*   [ ] Go2 successfully connects to the lab's Wi-Fi network.
*   [ ] You can SSH into the Go2's onboard computer from your host PC.
*   [ ] ROS 2 communication is established between host PC and Go2 (e.g., `ros2 topic list` on host shows topics published by Go2).

### Sensor Tests (via ROS 2)

*   [ ] **Go2 Built-in Camera**:
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows image topics (e.g., `/camera/image_raw`).
    *   [ ] `rqt_image_view` or `rviz2` displays live camera feeds from Go2.
*   [ ] **Go2 Built-in LiDAR**:
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows LiDAR scan topic (e.g., `/scan`).
    *   [ ] `rviz2` (with `LaserScan` display) shows live LiDAR data.
*   [ ] **Optional External Sensors (RealSense, External LiDAR)**:
    *   [ ] Relevant ROS 2 drivers are installed and nodes launched.
    *   [ ] `ros2 topic list` shows their respective topics.
    *   [ ] Data from external sensors is viewable in `rqt_image_view` or `rviz2`.

### Actuator Tests (via ROS 2 & SDK)

*   [ ] A simple ROS 2 publisher node can send velocity commands to the Go2 (e.g., `/cmd_vel`).
*   [ ] Go2 responds to velocity commands with appropriate locomotion.
*   [ ] Joint state topics (`/joint_states`) are published by the Go2.

### Software & ROS 2 Environment

*   [ ] ROS 2 Jazzy is correctly installed and sourced on the Go2's onboard computer.
*   [ ] Unitree Go2 SDK is installed and configured.
*   [ ] A simple ROS 2 package can be built (`colcon build`) on the Go2.
*   [ ] Python 3.10+ is available.

### Final Check

*   [ ] All external sensors securely mounted and connected.
*   [ ] Cables neatly routed and secured.
*   [ ] Battery fully charged.

Once all items are checked, your Mid-Tier Lab Unitree Go2 is ready to tackle dynamic locomotion and advanced perception tasks!
